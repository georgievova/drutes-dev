\subsection*{Modules}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
module {\bf dual\+\_\+coup}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This module contains variants of coupling terms of the dual permeability model. Boundary gets assigned mualem parameters in case(2) and (3). Case(1) The exchange term is calculated based on arithmetic mean of $Ka=\frac{Ka(hm)+Ka(hf)}{2}$. ~\newline
 Case(2) The exchange term is calculated based on geometric mean of $Ka=\sqrt{Ka(hm)*Ka(hf)}$. ~\newline
 Case(3) The exchange boundary term is constant.~\newline
 Case (4) and (5) don\textquotesingle{}t require further parameters. ~\newline
 Case(4) The exchange term is the minimum of $Ka=min(Km(hm),Kf(hf),Km(hf),Kf(hf))$ ~\newline
 Case(5) The exchange term is the minimum of $Ka=min(Km(hm*weight_m+hf*weight_f),Kf(hm*weight_m+hf*weight_f))$. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
\subsection*{Functions/\+Subroutines}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
real(kind=rkind) function, public {\bf dual\+\_\+coup\+::dual\+\_\+coupling} (pde\+\_\+loc, layer, quadpnt, x)
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Coupling defined for case(1), case (2) and case (3) Case(1) The exchange term is calculated based on arithmetic mean of $Ka=\frac{Ka(hm)+Ka(hf)}{2}$. ~\newline
 Case(2) The exchange term is calculated based on geometric mean of $Ka=\sqrt{Ka(hm)*Ka(hf)}$. ~\newline
 Case(3) The exchange boundary term is constant.~\newline
 \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
real(kind=rkind) function, public {\bf dual\+\_\+coup\+::dual\+\_\+coupling\+\_\+neg} (pde\+\_\+loc, layer, quadpnt, x)
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em neg coupling defined for case(1), case (2) and case (3) for coupled matrix, i.\+e. matrix part in fracture and fracture part in matrix. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
real(kind=rkind) function, public {\bf dual\+\_\+coup\+::dual\+\_\+coup\+\_\+min} (pde\+\_\+loc, layer, quadpnt, x)
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The following coupling schemes use the minimum value of case(4) $Ka=min(Km(hm),Kf(hf),Km(hf),Kf(hf))$ and case(5) $Ka=min(Km(hm*weight_m+hf*weight_f),Kf(hm*weight_m+hf*weight_f))$. ~\newline
 This has the advantage that no extra parameters need to be defined describing the hydraulic properties at the boundary~\newline
 This reduces the number of parameters to be estimated by 3\+: Kas, a, n ~\newline
 This also assures that the exchange term is always smaller than or equal the fracture and matrix conductivity. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
